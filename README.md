# SixthFormApplication
My A2 Computing Project - Provides a platform for people to apply to sixth form.

*What does it do?*

This allows students to apply to sixth form and stay in contact with the sixth form. First users apply by entering their own information, they must also input their secondary schools tutors' email address. After submitting the form an email is sent to the tutor to confirm the applicants' GCSE grades and attendance of the school. This would also require a human to confirm that is the applicants' tutor. 
After creating their account applicants can contact teachers who are teaching subjects which they have applied for. Applicants can also edit certain information about themselves.
Teachers also have accounts which they can use to view and message students who apply for their subjects.
There are also admin accounts which have total control over information on the site, in addition to being able to create and delete other accounts.
